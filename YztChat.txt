we are adding arrays to database with a logic based arrays index,
but this causes problems. push() method exist for that it inits a uid for list,
but i think it should be HashMap<String,Message> kind of... List gives error.


Last stayed place : GroupChat
Active Problem : Not updating list when message received and so hard optimization problem
Because getting all messages sorting all messages bla bla. It should be list or something else
